This project presents an end-to-end Power BI dashboard built using global university ranking datasets (QS, THE, ARWU) combined with country-level GDP and population data. The data was cleaned, transformed, and modeled into a snowflake schema to enable smooth filtering and cross-ranking comparison. Custom DAX measures such as Average Score, Female %, International Student %, and Staff Ratio help quantify key academic performance indicators across countries and ranking systems.

The dashboard provides interactive visual insights into global education patterns, including country-wise university distribution, ranking differences, score trends, and the relationship between economic indicators and university presence. It enables users to explore how nations perform in higher education, compare ranking methodologies, and understand demographic and academic factors influencing rankings.
